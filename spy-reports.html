			<h1>Spy Reports</h1>
      <blockquote>
        "Spy Reports" presents the best rumours and reports we can find, some of them from on-the-spot observers. Although TheOneRing.netâ„¢ makes every effort to find reliable sources, we cannot vouch for the truth of every rumour we are given. We would urge our spies to show the same respect towards cast and crew members as they would like to receive themseleves. We hope to be unobtrusive observers of the film-makers, and not to make their job more difficult.

				<h1>More ROTK Battle Scenes Info!</h1>
				7/31/03, 11:08 pm EST - <a href="#">{User}</a>
				<p>3rdOrcfromtheleft is back with more information on just what scenes they are filming at the studio backlots in Wellington. Take a look!</p>
        <p>Mostly our scenes consisted of Gondorians awaiting the Orc army to arrive at Minas Tirith, the battle then occuring with bows and arrows, a catapult, with the Orcs using the same as well as Nasgul arriving.</p>
        <p>Then we did the opposite, as Orcs lining up and marching to Minas Tirith; some of the battle - firing arrows, dodging CG rocks; the arrival of Aragorn and his ghost ships (all green screen); lastly, dead and dying Orcs and Rohans.</p>
